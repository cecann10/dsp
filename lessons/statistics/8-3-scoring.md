[Think Stats Chapter 8 Exercise 3](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2009.html#toc77)

---
In a test where lam = 2 and m = 1_000_000:
- **Mean Error = -1.500**
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) = 1.659**
- **90% Confidence Interval = (0, 2)**

The mean error is small and decreases with m, so this estimator appears to be unbiased.
