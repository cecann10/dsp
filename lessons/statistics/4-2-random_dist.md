[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

The PMF graph shows as one large block in a graph because each number has the same probability.  It's not more or less likely to appear over the others.

The CDF graph does show a uniform distribution (i.e. steady increase from bottom left to top right) because it is an even distribution of numbers.
