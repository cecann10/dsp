[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

The 'Cohen's d' between first babies' weights and all other babies' weights is  -0.089.
Based on this finding, first babies are slightly more likely to be lighter than other (i.e. non-first) babies.

On the other hand, 'Cohen's d' between length of first pregnancies and length of all other pregnancies is  0.029, therefore in this case first pregnancies are slightly more likely to be longer in length compared to all other (i.e. non-first) pregnancies.
