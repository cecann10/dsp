[Think Stats Chapter 6 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2007.html#toc60) (household income)

Income data:
- **Median = 51226.45**
- **Mean = 74278.71**
- **Pearson's Median Skewness = 0.73613**
- **Percent under mean = 66%**

As the upper bound assumption grows...
- the **median does not change**.
- the **mean increases**.
- the **Pearson's Median Skewness decreases**.
- the **percent under the mean increases**.
