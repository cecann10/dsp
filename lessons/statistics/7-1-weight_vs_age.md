[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

When comparing mother's age to baby's weight...
- A scatter plot shows a cluster with **no strong indicatation of a relationship** between the two sets of data.
- The **Pearson's Correlation 0.06883397035410908** and a **Spearman's Rank Correlation of 0.09461004109658226** further indicates that there is not a strong correlation.
- When plotting percentiles between the two sets, while there is some indication of higher weight as a mother's age rises between 15 and 23, after that there **does not seem to be a clear linear relationship**.

**In conclusion, based on the analysis above, a mother's age and a baby's weight do not seem to be correlated.**
